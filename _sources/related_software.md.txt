## Other open source LoD2+ building reconstruction software

- [Polyfit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit) performs true 3D building reconstruction from point clouds as opposed to roofer that 'just' does 2.5D. This also means a more complete building point cloud is required, that also includes all the facades. Typical airborne lidar point clouds are therefor not suitable.
- [City3D](https://github.com/tudelft3d/city3d) is more similar to roofer, in what it aims to do: 2.5D building reconstruction from a point cloud and a roofprint polygon.
