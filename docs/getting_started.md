# Getting started

At this moment we do not yet provide separate pre-compiled binaries for roofer. To get started with roofer you need to either compile it from the sourcecode yourself or you can use the automatically built [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/3dgi/roofer/tags). Once roofer version 1.0 will be released, we expect to provide pre-compiled binaries for the most common platforms.

## Compilation from source

To ease getting the required dependencies it is recommended to use [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) to build **roofer**.

Follow the [vcpkg instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd) to set it up.

After *vcpkg* is set up, set the ``VCPKG_ROOT`` environment variable to point to the directory where vcpkg is installed.

On *macOS* you need to install additional build tools:

```{code-block} shell
brew install autoconf autoconf-archive automake libtool
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/m4/bin:$PATH"
```

On *Ubuntu* you need to install additional build tools:

```{code-block} shell
apt install autoconf bison flex libtool
```

Clone the roofer repository and use one of the CMake presets to build the roofer.

```{code-block} shell
git clone https://github.com/3DBAG/roofer.git
cd roofer
mkdir build
cmake --preset vcpkg-minimal -S . -B build
cmake --build build
# Optionally, install roofer
cmake --install build
```
