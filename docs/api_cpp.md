# API Reference C++

The roofer C++ API allows you to use the roofer as a C++ library. Most notably it provides a `reconstruct()` function that takes a pointcloud and a roofprint polygon for a single building object and returns a reconstructed building model mesh.

> [!NOTE]
> Because roofer internally uses floats to represent coordinates, it is advised to translate your data to the origin prior to calling `reconstruct()` to prevent loss of precision.

See [this file](https://github.com/3DBAG/roofer/blob/develop/tests/test_reconstruct_api.cpp) for a short example of how to use the C++ bindings.
